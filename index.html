        <h3>About me...</h3>
        <p>Hi my name is Billy McGuinness, 
        I’m 37 years old and have always been interested in any kind of technology.
        I have been gaming since being 10 years old and built/rebuilt my desktop PC multiple times.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the past I have looked into writing code for Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel, where I made a few little applications
        for the DWP when I worked in the civil service.
        <br>
        <br>    
        I have also looked into learning Python quite recently and sometimes use Linux 
        terminal on my Raspberry Pi 3.
        <br>
        <br>    
        I decided to come to Code Nation as I was interested in learning something which I am 
        really passionate about 
        and coding is something I really want to get in to. I have already completed the 3 week course in Cyber Security
        at Code Nation and got graded with an A. I am hoping to move into the 12 week master course in coding with
        an opportunity of starting a career in this area.
        <br>
        <br>    
        My experience so far of studying with Code Nation has been really positive. Everybody at Code Nation is
        very friendly and approachable.

        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
            <p>
                    IT in modern business is needed to communicate fast and efficiently 
                    with individuals, organisations or IT systems. 
                    Modern businesses also rely on IT to process data and keep up with market intelligence.
                    IT in modern business 
                    plays an important role in all types of industry, which helps improve processes within a business, 
                    help to competitively
                    maintain an advantage in the marketplace and achieve cost efficiencies.

        <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete
                digital projects successfully – 
                what do you need to make projects
                successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
                <p>
                        Depending on the project and whether or not you are working individually 
                        or collaboratively within a team, there are methods, skills and resources 
                        needed to complete digital projects successfully. Methods I would use are 
                        documenting all research and sharing it within my team if it is a collaboration. 
                        I would also implement regular reviews (stand-ups) to monitor progress. 
                        Tools which could be useful are but not limited to; Trello, Slack and Google Drive. 
                        Trello can be used as a digital version of a kanban board to monitor progress of 
                        tasks within a project (what needs to be done, what is being worked on and what has 
                        been completed). Slack is a great tool for communicating with a team working on a 
                        project from anywhere in the world. Features of Slack; video calling, sharing code, 
                        text, images to keep up to date with all aspects of a project. Google Drive can be 
                        used to create, edit, store and share different types of documents with individuals 
                        which helps to keep content fresh. Skills needed would have to be a good knowledge of 
                        aspects of a project with a good ability to problem solve.

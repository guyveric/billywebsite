        <h3>About me...</h3>
        <p>Hi my name is Billy McGuinness, 
        Iâ€™m 37 years old and have always been interested in any kind of technology.
        I have been gaming since being 10 years old and built/rebuilt my desktop PC multiple times.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the past I have looked into writing code for Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel, where I made a few little applications
        for the DWP when I worked in the civil service.
        <br>
        <br>    
        I have also looked into learning Python quite recently and sometimes use Linux 
        terminal on my Raspberry Pi 3.
        <br>
        <br>    
        I decided to come to Code Nation as I was interested in learning something which I am 
        really passionate about 
        and coding is something I really want to get in to. I have already completed the 3 week course in Cyber Security
        at Code Nation and got graded with an A. I am hoping to move into the 12 week master course in coding with
        an opportunity of starting a career in this area.
        <br>
        <br>    
        My experience so far of studying with Code Nation has been really positive. Everybody at Code Nation is
        very friendly and approachable.
        <br>
        <br>
        Apart from being passionate about all types of technology, I also really like to sing. I use to go on the karaoke locally and back in 2009 went to audition for the X-Factor. Here are a few videos of me singing;

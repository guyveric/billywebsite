                                IT in modern business is needed to communicate fast and efficiently 
                                with individuals, organisations or IT systems. 
                                Modern businesses also rely on IT to process data and keep up with market intelligence.
                                IT in modern business 
                                plays an important role in all types of industry, which helps improve processes within a business, 
                                help to competitively
                                maintain an advantage in the marketplace and achieve cost efficiencies.

                            digital projects successfully – 
                            what do you need to make projects
                            successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
                            <p class="font1">
                                    Depending on the project and whether or not you are working individually 
                                    or collaboratively within a team, there are methods, skills and resources 
                                    needed to complete digital projects successfully. Methods I would use are 
                                    documenting all research and sharing it within my team if it is a collaboration. 
                                    I would also implement regular reviews (stand-ups) to monitor progress. 
                                    Tools which could be useful are but not limited to; Trello, Slack and Google Drive. 
                                    Trello can be used as a digital version of a kanban board to monitor progress of 
                                    tasks within a project (what needs to be done, what is being worked on and what has 
                                    been completed). Slack is a great tool for communicating with a team working on a 
                                    project from anywhere in the world. Features of Slack; video calling, sharing code, 
                                    text, images to keep up to date with all aspects of a project. Google Drive can be 
                                    used to create, edit, store and share different types of documents with individuals 
                                    which helps to keep content fresh. Skills needed would have to be a good knowledge of 
                                    aspects of a project with a good ability to problem solve.

                            <p class="font1">
                                    I am going to plan out making my website by breaking down each task and placing them onto my 
                                    Trello board.  I can then use the kanban method so I can see what needs to be done, what I am 
                                    working on and what I have completed. When I am working on a specific task I will move it into 
                                    the ‘WIP’ section of my Trello board, then once completed move it into the ‘Done’ section of my 
                                    Trello board. This process will loop and continue until I have finished all the tasks I have 
                                    assigned myself to be completed.

                            causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
                            <p class="font1">
                                    The risks that might impact digital projects are not having the right tools, 
                                    skills, experience or access to expertise/information to successfully 
                                    produce projects to a high standard. The reasons potentially why digital 
                                    projects fail are; 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    1) Lack of knowledge, experience or expertise for team members working on a project.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    2) Lack of access to the right tools, for example; <br> 
                                    hardware or software based tools that are needed to achieve a desired goal.

                                    3) Lack of planning or research on a project which would help with getting 
                                            things right first time. Having to redo part or all of a project could 
                                            potentially have financial implications.

                            <p class="font1">
                                    The MacBook Pro provided by Code Nation has more than enough 
                                    processing power and RAM to help me achieve my goal of building a 
                                    website (blog). The software needed to create my website is installed, 
                                    up to date and is called Visual Studio Code. I have used Visual Studio 
                                    Code on a previous project and found it to be really easy to use with 
                                    some great features. When I started this project with creating my website 
                                    (blog) I set up a Trello board to monitor my progress visually. This has 
                                    really helped me in keeping track of tasks I need to do, what I am currently 
                                    working on and what has been completed. On a previous project I set up a 
                                    GitHub account and synced it with Visual Studio Code to easily stored code 
                                    I was working on. I found this really beneficial as by keeping GitHub up to 
                                    date with the latest code I was working on, I was sure the code was fresh and 
                                    it reduced the risk of losing what I was working on. So for this project I am 
                                    going to set up a new GitHub repository to store my website code.

                            projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
                            <p class="font1">
                                    The GDPR replaces the data protection directive [1995] 
                                    (UK law was based upon this directive) and is a new framework 
                                    for data protection laws within Europe. GDPR was created to 
                                    modernise the laws that are in place to protect personal 
                                    information of individuals and came into force on 25th May 2018. 
                                    This replaces data protection laws across Europe which were created 
                                    during the 1990’s and gives individuals more rights/control regarding 
                                    their personal information. Also it alters how information regarding 
                                    customers of businesses and public sector organisations is handled/stored. 
                                    GDPR enforces data minimisation for all businesses/organisations that use 
                                    to store/collect data for potential future use. So the impact on digital 
                                    projects is to redesign to take into account the GDPR regulations and not 
                                    complying to GDPR could have negative financial implications for the 
                                    individuals/organisations involved.

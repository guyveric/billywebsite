                <p>
                        Copyright and other constraints like intellectual property laws 
                        affect websites, as they can restrict what you are legally allowed 
                        to publish. Copyright is a means of protecting original works by 
                        individuals or organisations and can only be used by outside sources 
                        with expressed permission from the original author(s). Copyright 
                        covers both published and unpublished works.

        <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe
                issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages
                and how we can overcome them</h3>
                <p>
                        Disabilities of different kinds affect people in many different ways 
                        when trying to access websites, for example; a blind person would not 
                        be able to see the display and a way of overcoming this issue would be 
                        to rely on either on-screen readers and/or refreshable braille displays. 
                        Another example; an individual with physical disabilities might not be able 
                        to use the hardware to navigate the device they are using and so a way of 
                        overcoming this issue would be to rely on voice-recognition software to take 
                        commands from the user by talking to the device.

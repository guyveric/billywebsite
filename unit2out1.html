                <p class="font1">
                                By using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in conjunction with HTML, each page consists of a blue/black coding image and a navigation bar at the top with a self made logo. On the navigation bar there is a matrix style code image displayed and three links “About me”, “Unit 1” and “Unit 2”. Each of these links when clicked on, navigate to their corresponding pages. The “About me” link takes the user to a page that consists of information regarding myself, plus three YouTube videos of me singing on various karaoke nights. The “Unit1” link takes the user to the “Unit1” page which contains three image links for “Outcome 1”, “Outcome 2” and “Outcome 3”  and each of those links when clicked navigate to their corresponding pages within the website structure. All pages on my website have the same theme throughout; A different font and colour for the title of the page, questions, answers and links.<br><br>

                                Since writing my answer for the question above I have updated the look of my website. I have changed the look of my navbar, used @media in CSS to make sure the pages adjust to different screen sizes and added a launching page with an animated gif file for the background. Below are some screenshots to show my updates;

                        <p class="font1">
                            Disabilities of different kinds affect people in many different ways 
                            when trying to access websites, for example; a blind person would not 
                            be able to see the display and a way of overcoming this issue would be 
                            to rely on either on-screen readers and/or refreshable braille displays. 
                            Another example; an individual with physical disabilities might not be able 
                            to use the hardware to navigate the device they are using and so a way of 
                            overcoming this issue would be to rely on voice-recognition software to take 
                            commands from the user by talking to the device.

            <h3 class="font3">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
                    <p class="font1">
                                There are many different file types which can be appropriately used for websites. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is both a file format and a language in which a web page is written in. There are several image formats which can be used for websites, common file types include JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and PNG (Portable Network Graphics). The difference between these two file types is JPEG is used for images containing a lot of different colours, for example; photographs. It is also a good image file type to save storage space, as it can reduce the size of highly detailed image files. PNG is used for images that contain transparent backgrounds or small images, for example; logos. Like image file formats there are also several choices when it comes to audio file formats, common file types include WAV and AAC (Advanced Audio Coding). The difference between these two file types is WAV is uncompressed audio (which is virtually lossless), is used for short sound effects in applications and raw sound samples. AAC is like MP3 but was designed to be an improvement over that file format. It is lossy compressed but, can produce better sound quality at the same file size and bitrate as compared to MP3. There are also several video file formats which can be used, common file types include WebM and AVI (Audio Video Interleave). WebM is quite a new open video file format and is used for embedded video clips which are short in length to work in conjunction with HTML5 technologies. AVI is quite an old video file format which is uncompressed and is widely popular in file sharing communities. There are many more file format types than I can mention for using on a website, but the ones I have mentioned are only a small amount. To find out all file types you can search online for the extensive list.

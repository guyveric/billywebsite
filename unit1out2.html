                                needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools
                                you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>

                                    The tools I chose to use to make my website have worked quite well. 
                                    I set up a Trello board with all the tasks I need to complete, 
                                    to achieve the goal of creating my blog website. I can see a visual 
                                    representation of all tasks I need to do, what I am currently working 
                                    on and what I have completed. Visual Studio Code is really easy to use 
                                    and has a lot of useful features. I am also using the google search engine 
                                    to research html code to use in developing my website.

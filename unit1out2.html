                        <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as
                                needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools
                                you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
                            <p>
                                    The tools I chose to use to make my website have worked quite well. 
                                    I set up a Trello board with all the tasks I need to complete, 
                                    to achieve the goal of creating my blog website. I can see a visual 
                                    representation of all tasks I need to do, what I am currently working 
                                    on and what I have completed. Visual Studio Code is really easy to use 
                                    and has a lot of useful features. I am also using the google search engine 
                                    to research html code to use in developing my website.

                <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g.
                        Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
                        <p>
                                The IT tools I used; Visual Studio Code, Trello and Google search engine were appropriate IT tools to use to design/develop my website (blog). Visual Studio Code let me design/develop my website by typing HTML code into the program. Trello let me keep track of my progress whilst working on my project. I could see a visual representation of the kanban method. Google search engine was good for looking up information useful in designing my website.

                                needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools
                                you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
                            <p class="font1">
                                    The tools I chose to use to make my website have worked quite well. 
                                    I set up a Trello board with all the tasks I need to complete, 
                                    to achieve the goal of creating my blog website. I can see a visual 
                                    representation of all tasks I need to do, what I am currently working 
                                    on and what I have completed. Visual Studio Code is really easy to use 
                                    and has a lot of useful features. I am also using the google search engine 
                                    to research html code to use in developing my website.

                        Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>

                                The IT tools I used; Visual Studio Code, Trello and Google search engine were appropriate IT tools to use to design/develop my website (blog). Visual Studio Code let me design/develop my website by typing HTML code into the program. Trello let me keep track of my progress whilst working on my project. I could see a visual representation of the kanban method. Google search engine was good for looking up information useful in designing my website.

                        Change?</h3>
                        <p class="font1">
                                        I found creating the website quite straightforward in HTML, but incorporating CSS was a little strange at first but I got to grips with it in the end. I am happy with the website I have created. It has a navbar with background image which I am quite pleased with. It took me a few tries to get it right but I eventually got it how I wanted it. All the links work as they should do and navigate to the correct pages that they were assigned to. I think that the text on the web pages is easy to read, as after adding a shadow to it the text is more prominent. I am going to continue changing, updating this website even after this course has ended now its initially been created. If I were to change anything it would probably be to add a dropdown feature to the navbar, which would be easier for navigation within the website and also would reduce the page total by two.

                        <p class="font1">
                                Other than adding a dropdown feature to the navbar for an easier way of navigating the website, I think I would like to improve on the logo images I created. I also think that incorporating some Javascript into the website to add a bit of something extra to it would be great. I also think I would go through all the code I used to create the website and see if I could simplify it a bit.

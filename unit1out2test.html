                                needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools
                                you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>

                                    The tools I chose to use to make my website have worked quite well. 
                                    I set up a Trello board with all the tasks I need to complete, 
                                    to achieve the goal of creating my blog website. I can see a visual 
                                    representation of all tasks I need to do, what I am currently working 
                                    on and what I have completed. Visual Studio Code is really easy to use 
                                    and has a lot of useful features. I am also using the google search engine 
                                    to research html code to use in developing my website.

                                The IT tools I used; Visual Studio Code, Trello and Google search engine were appropriate IT tools to use to design/develop my website (blog). Visual Studio Code let me design/develop my website by typing HTML code into the program. Trello let me keep track of my progress whilst working on my project. I could see a visual representation of the kanban method. Google search engine was good for looking up information useful in designing my website.

                        Change?</h3>
                        <p class="font1">
                                        I found creating the website quite straightforward in HTML, but incorporating CSS was a little strange at first but I got to grips with it in the end. I am happy with the website I have created. It has a navbar with background image which I am quite pleased with. It took me a few tries to get it right but I eventually got it how I wanted it. All the links work as they should do and navigate to the correct pages that they were assigned to. I think that the text on the web pages is easy to read, as after adding a shadow to it the text is more prominent. I am going to continue changing, updating this website even after this course has ended now its initially been created. If I were to change anything it would probably be to add a dropdown feature to the navbar, which would be easier for navigation within the website and also would reduce the page total by two.

                        <p class="font1">
                                Other than adding a dropdown feature to the navbar for an easier way of navigating the website, I think I would like to improve on the logo images I created. I also think that incorporating some Javascript into the website to add a bit of something extra to it would be great. I also think I would go through all the code I used to create the website and see if I could simplify it a bit.

                                When I started this project I didn’t know what my website would look like, but I had a brief which guided me to what to include for content within it. Looking at this question I have chosen four questions which are a part of ‘Unit 2 Outcome 1’ and are not included in the written aspect of this assignment;
                                <br>

                                <b class="font4">Unit 2 - 1.2 Plan and create your website:</b> <p class="font1">
                                To plan my website I firstly looked at other websites to get ideas and researched HTML code to start coding the barebones of the web pages. I started off implementing the HTML code into Visual Studio Code, that then created a basic web page with a white background and black standard text with no text alignment. I then started researching CSS and created a CSS file. I linked the CSS file to my HTML file and started inputting code into CSS to design the web page. I added a background image and sorted out the text alignment to how I wanted it. I used the CSS file in conjunction with the HTML files I created for each page to add colour and structure to my website. I pushed all my website content periodically to my GitHub account where it is stored.</p></p>

                                  <b class="font4">Unit 2 - 1.3 Selecting and using web site features and structure:</b><p class="font1">I decided to create a fixed navbar which would be situated to the top of each web page within my website. On the navbar I placed a logo I created to the left and three links which navigate to the three main pages within my website structure. I copied the HTML code from the index.html page and pasted it into every page on my website so the navbar would consistently show up. I edited the HTML code in each page to take into accountwhat pages they are, the content they contain and how the pages navigate to each other.</p> </p>

                                <b class="font4">Unit 2 - 1.4 Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent:</b><br> The style I went for was the same blue/black background image for each web page within my website structure. I also created a navbar with its own green/black background image, which also contained a logo I created and three main links that navigated to other web pages within my website structure. I set all ‘H1’, ‘H2’ and ‘H3’ tags in my CSS file to show a different font type, font size and colour (I also added a shadow to all text contained within my website. I added a hover feature on the navbar, so when you hover over a link within the navbar it highlights it with a transparent colour.</p>

                                <b class="font4">Unit 2 - 1.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively:</b><br> Whilst creating my website using Visual Studio Code I setup a folder on the desktop of the computer I was using. This stored all files needed for my website. I also linked my GitHub account to Visual Studio Code and pushed all content to my GitHub repository. I do a push to my repository after I make a change in any code on my website so its always up to date.</p>

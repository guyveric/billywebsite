  <p>Hi my name is Billy McGuinness, 
  Iâ€™m 37 years old and have always been interested in any kind of technology.
  I have been gaming since being 10 years old and built/rebuilt my desktop PC multiple times.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past I have looked into writing code for Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel, where I made a few little applications
  for the DWP when I worked in the civil service.
  <br>
  <br>    
  I have also looked into learning Python quite recently and sometimes use Linux 
  terminal on my Raspberry Pi 3.
  <br>
  <br>    
  I decided to come to Code Nation as I was interested in learning something which I am 
  really passionate about 
  and coding is something I really want to get in to. I have already completed the 3 week course in Cyber Security
  at Code Nation and got graded with an A. 
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br><p>
  I am hoping to move into the 12 week master course in coding with
  an opportunity of starting a career in this area.
  <br>
  <br>    
  My experience so far of studying with Code Nation has been really positive. Everybody at Code Nation is
  very friendly and approachable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from being passionate about all types of technology, I also really like to sing. I used to go on the karaoke locally and back in 2009 went to audition for the X-Factor. Here are a few videos of me singing;</p>

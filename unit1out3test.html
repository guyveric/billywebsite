                            terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more
                            efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in
                            teams?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="font1">
                                        I think the IT tools and systems I used in regards of making my website were efficient enough to get the task done. One drawback in my opinion was that I had to do the task using a MacBook Pro. I only say that as I rarely use any Apple products and mostly use a standard desktop computer running Windows 10. So it was a learning curve having to get use to the subtle differences between the two devices. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Another drawback I could say was using software I wasn’t familiar with, as I had to learn how to use it to complete my task. Both drawbacks would have slowed me down in terms of productivity and also having to learn the hardware/software would have made me less efficient. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The benefits of using the IT tools and systems in question are learning something new and getting used to different systems/devices. This then adds to my skill set/knowledge which will benefit me with any future endeavours. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I think if I had been using a Windows based operating system and software I was familiar with, I would have been more productive/efficient. I didn’t mind working on this website on my own, but working as a team does have some added benefits. Each person could work on a webpage and then they could be combined on a later date, one team member could be researching ways to code HTML/CSS efficiently to get what we want out of our website and the others could have individually assigned tasks which make up the complete task as a whole.

                                        Working on a device that's familiar to the individual or team working on an assigned task/project, as this in my opinion would cut down on time used trying to learn how to use a certain device. That time could then be used to focus on the task at hand. Better efficiency comes with familiarity and knowledge. This is because if an individual/team is using a device or piece of software they know in and out, the task could be potentially completed more quickly without worrying about how things work or what certain devices/software can do.

                projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use

                    <p class="font1">
                                If I was to work on a digital project like this again, I think I would prefer to work collaboratively as part of a team. This way I think knowledge shared would make each individual more productive and efficient, including myself. I would also look over previous projects to get ideas that worked which I could use as solutions to improve my own productivity. I would also keep using the Trello board implementing the kanban method, to keep track of the progress regarding the project I am working on and for communication I would use Slack, as it is a really useful tool to use to communicate with individuals on a project or to ask for advice/solutions from like minded people, to problems that may arise.

                <p class="font1">
                                Depending on the project there are numerous ways I can mention to test digital solutions. For the project I have been working on, where I have been planning and developing my own website(blog). I would access my website through a couple of different websites, for example; Google Chrome and Safari. I would check the website to see if the layout, colour, content and links all function as they should. If not I would go back through Visual Studio Code and tweak a few things until I got it right. If I can’t seem to fix an error I would research a solution, either by asking someone who may have the knowledge I need or by looking for information on the internet. Once I was happy with it I would send the link to a few different people to beta test it to see if they can find any bugs/errors that I didn’t notice.<br><br>
Below are screenshots taken of my websites to test different browsers. I chose to use Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
